# Farm Buddy


An World of Warcraft AddOn that adds the functionality to Track multiple farmed items. An notification will appear if the defined goal quantity for an item has reached.

**Quickstart**  
Alt + Right click on an Item in your Bags or Bank to start tracking.
You can also enter the name of the desired Item in the AddOn settings.

**Features**  
* Track farmed Items
* Track inventory or inventory and bank quantity
* Define a optional quantity for the farmed item
* Shows a notification if the item quantity has reached
* Select an optional sound for the notification
* Customize notification effects
* Localized (English and German)
* Shortcut for fast tracking (ALT + right click)

**Please note:** Through the limitation of the API functions it is currently only possible to track known items. That means the items have to be in your data cache (Opened Tooltips, Inventory, Bank etc.)
The item name will be validated if you set it if the item name is invalid or not known by the API you will see a notification.
